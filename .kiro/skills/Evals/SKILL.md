name: Evals
description: "Comprehensive AI agent evaluation framework with three grader types (code-based: deterministic/fast; model-based: nuanced/LLM rubric; human: gold standard) and pass@k / pass^k scoring. Evaluates agent transcripts, tool-call sequences, and multi-turn conversations — not just single outputs. Supports capability evals (~70% pass target) and regression evals (~99% pass target). Workflows: RunEval, CompareModels, ComparePrompts, CreateJudge, CreateUseCase, RunScenario, CreateScenario, ViewResults. Integrates with THE ALGORITHM ISC rows for automated verification. Domain patterns pre-configured for coding, conversational, research, and computer-use agent types in Data/DomainPatterns.yaml. Tools: AlgorithmBridge.ts (ISC integration), FailureToTask.ts (failures → tasks), SuiteManager.ts (create/graduate/saturation-check), ScenarioRunner.ts (multi-turn simulated-user), TranscriptCapture.ts, PAIAgentAdapter.ts (wraps Inference.ts), ScenarioToTranscript.ts. Code-based graders: string_match, regex_match, binary_tests, static_analysis, state_check, tool_calls. Model-based graders: llm_rubric, natural_language_assert, pairwise_comparison. USE WHEN eval, evaluate, benchmark, regression test, run eval, compare models, compare prompts, create judge, test agent, quality check, pass@k, grader, agent transcript, scenario simulation, capability test, before/after comparison, suite saturation, failure to task, graduate suite.

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Evals/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Evals skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Evals** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# Evals - AI Agent Evaluation Framework

Comprehensive agent evaluation system based on Anthropic's "Demystifying Evals for AI Agents" (Jan 2026).

**Key differentiator:** Evaluates agent *workflows* (transcripts, tool calls, multi-turn conversations), not just single outputs.

---

## When to Activate

- "run evals", "test this agent", "evaluate", "check quality", "benchmark"
- "regression test", "capability test"
- "run scenario", "multi-turn eval", "simulated user test"
- "create scenario", "simulate conversation"
- Compare agent behaviors across changes
- Validate agent workflows before deployment
- Verify ALGORITHM ISC rows
- Create new evaluation tasks from failures

---

## Core Concepts

### Three Grader Types

| Type | Strengths | Weaknesses | Use For |
|------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Code-based** | Fast, cheap, deterministic, reproducible | Brittle, lacks nuance | Tests, state checks, tool verification |
| **Model-based** | Flexible, captures nuance, scalable | Non-deterministic, expensive | Quality rubrics, assertions, comparisons |
| **Human** | Gold standard, handles subjectivity | Expensive, slow | Calibration, spot checks, A/B testing |

### Evaluation Types

| Type | Pass Target | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Capability** | ~70% | Stretch goals, measuring improvement potential |
| **Regression** | ~99% | Quality gates, detecting backsliding |

### Key Metrics

- **pass@k**: Probability of at least 1 success in k trials (measures capability)
- **pass^k**: Probability all k trials succeed (measures consistency/reliability)

| Request Pattern | Route To |
|---|---|

### CLI Quick Reference

| Trigger | Tool |
|---------|------|
| Run suite | `Tools/AlgorithmBridge.ts` |
| Log failure | `Tools/FailureToTask.ts log` |
| Convert failures | `Tools/FailureToTask.ts convert-all` |

## Quick Reference

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Run an eval suite
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/AlgorithmBridge.ts -s <suite>

# Log a failure for later conversion
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/FailureToTask.ts log "description" -c category -s severity

# Convert failures to test tasks
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/FailureToTask.ts convert-all

# Manage suites
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/SuiteManager.ts create <name> -t capability -d "description"
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/SuiteManager.ts list
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/SuiteManager.ts check-saturation <name>
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/SuiteManager.ts graduate <name>
```

### ALGORITHM Integration

Evals is a verification method for THE ALGORITHM ISC rows:

```bash
# Run eval and update ISC row
bun run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/Tools/AlgorithmBridge.ts -s regression-core -r 3 -u
```

ISC rows can specify eval verification:
```
| # | What Ideal Looks Like | Verify |
|---|----------------------|--------|
| 1 | Auth bypass fixed | eval:auth-security |
| 2 | Tests all pass | eval:regression |
```

## Available Graders

### Code-Based (Fast, Deterministic)

| Grader | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `string_match` | Exact substring matching |
| `regex_match` | Pattern matching |
| `binary_tests` | Run test files |
| `static_analysis` | Lint, type-check, security scan |
| `state_check` | Verify system state after execution |
| `tool_calls` | Verify specific tools were called |

### Model-Based (Nuanced)

| Grader | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `llm_rubric` | Score against detailed rubric |
| `natural_language_assert` | Check assertions are true |
| `pairwise_comparison` | Compare to reference with position swap |

---

## Domain Patterns

Pre-configured grader stacks for common agent types:

| Domain | Primary Graders |
|--------|-----------------|
| `coding` | binary_tests + static_analysis + tool_calls + llm_rubric |
| `conversational` | llm_rubric + natural_language_assert + state_check |
| `research` | llm_rubric + natural_language_assert + tool_calls |
| `computer_use` | state_check + tool_calls + llm_rubric |

See `Data/DomainPatterns.yaml` for full configurations.

## Key Principles (from Anthropic)

1. **Start with 20-50 real failures** - Don't overthink, capture what actually broke
2. **Unambiguous tasks** - Two experts should reach identical verdicts
3. **Balanced problem sets** - Test both "should do" AND "should NOT do"
4. **Grade outputs, not paths** - Don't penalize valid creative solutions
5. **Calibrate LLM judges** - Against human expert judgment
6. **Check transcripts regularly** - Verify graders work correctly
7. **Monitor saturation** - Graduate to regression when hitting 95%+
8. **Build infrastructure early** - Evals shape how quickly you can adopt new models

## Gotchas

- **Choose the right grader type:** Code-based for deterministic checks (fast, cheap). Model-based for nuanced quality (flexible, expensive). Human for calibration (gold standard, slow).
- **pass@k scoring requires multiple runs.** A single run doesn't give statistical significance. Default to pass@3 minimum.
- **Transcript capture must be enabled BEFORE the test run.** Can't retroactively capture transcripts.
- **Eval results go to the current work directory** — not a global location. Tie evals to the work item.
- **Don't evaluate skills with trivial prompts.** Simple one-liners may not trigger skill usage. Test prompts must be substantive.

## Examples

**Example 1: Compare two prompts**
```
User: "evaluate which prompt produces better summaries"
→ Creates eval suite with 3+ test cases
→ Runs both prompts against test cases
→ Model-based grader scores quality
→ Reports pass@k and comparative analysis
```

**Example 2: Regression test a skill change**
```
User: "run evals on the Research skill after the update"
→ Uses existing test fixtures for Research
→ Before/after comparison
→ Reports any quality regressions
```

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Evals","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
