# FindLeverage Workflow — SystemsThinking

## Purpose

Apply Donella Meadows' **12 Leverage Points** to a system to find **where a small change produces a large, durable effect**. Most interventions target weak leverage points (parameters, buffers) where effort is high and returns are low. Meadows' insight: leverage increases dramatically as you move up the list, but so does resistance.

This is the workflow to run after you have a CLD (`CausalLoop.md`) or archetype identification (`FindArchetype.md`) and are choosing *where* to intervene.

## Invocation

- "Leverage point"
- "Where should we intervene?"
- "Highest-leverage change"
- After CausalLoop — the CLD shows the structure; this workflow tells you what to push on
- After FindArchetype — the archetype suggests a category of intervention; this workflow ranks options

## The 12 Leverage Points (Meadows 1999)

Ordered from **least** leverage (12) to **most** (1). Reversed from how you'd instinctively attack a problem.

### 12. Constants, Parameters, Numbers

**What:** Subsidies, taxes, standards, capacity limits, retry counts, SLA thresholds.

**Why weakest:** Parameters rarely change system behavior. Politicians love them because they're visible; systems ignore them unless they cross a structural threshold.

**When useful:** When the parameter *is* the threshold that triggers a structural effect (e.g., a rate limit that actually changes resource contention dynamics).

**Example in software:** Changing a timeout from 5s to 10s. Won't change the underlying latency distribution; just shifts where the failure surfaces.

---

### 11. Buffers — The Size of Stabilizing Stocks

**What:** Inventory, cash reserves, queue depths, cache sizes, team slack.

**Why weak:** Buffers stabilize but don't change the generating dynamics. Too large = expensive and slow to respond; too small = fragile.

**When useful:** When a buffer is *too small* to absorb normal variation, fixing the size is genuinely structural.

**Example in software:** Increasing a Kafka topic's retention. Absorbs spikes; doesn't fix the producer/consumer imbalance.

---

### 10. Stock-and-Flow Structures — Physical Systems and Their Nodes

**What:** The actual topology — pipelines, networks, road layouts, org charts, service graphs.

**Why moderate:** Changing physical structure has real effect but is often extremely expensive. Also: you usually can't change it without rebuilding.

**When useful:** Architecture decisions, re-orgs, platform migrations. When you can change the structure, do so deliberately — the structure you pick will generate behavior for years.

**Example in software:** Monolith → microservices (or back). Structural change, massive impact, massive cost. Rarely the right leverage point *within* an existing system.

---

### 9. Delays — Lengths of Time Relative to Rates of Change

**What:** Perception delays, decision delays, action delays, feedback delays.

**Why strong:** Delays cause oscillation, overshoot, and surprise. Reducing the feedback delay can fix behavior that no parameter change fixes.

**When useful:** Any system with oscillation or overshoot — deploy pipelines that swing between "deploying everything" and "deploying nothing," alerting that oscillates between noisy and silent.

**Example in software:** p99 monitoring on a 5-minute rolling window vs. 1-hour. The shorter window lets you respond before the incident escalates.

---

### 8. Balancing Feedback Loops — Strength Relative to the Impact They Try to Correct

**What:** The correcting loops — negative feedback, goal-seeking.

**Why strong:** Weak balancing loops let the system overshoot. Strong ones stabilize. Many failures come from balancing loops that aren't strong enough for the perturbation.

**When useful:** Scaling incidents, runaway dynamics, quality decay — look for the balancing loop and ask "why isn't it strong enough?"

**Example in software:** Autoscaler with a slow reaction time. Reinforcing loop of traffic growth overwhelms it. Strengthen the balancing loop: faster scale-up, more predictive, lower trigger threshold.

---

### 7. Reinforcing Feedback Loops — Strength of the Gain

**What:** The amplifying loops — positive feedback, vicious/virtuous cycles.

**Why strong (and dangerous):** Reinforcing loops drive exponential change. Strengthen a good one (adoption, learning), weaken a bad one (debt accretion, runaway costs).

**When useful:** Growth dynamics, tech debt, alert fatigue, learning cycles.

**Example in software:** Onboarding speed determines how fast new hires contribute, which determines how fast they mentor the next hires. Strengthen this R loop and team velocity compounds.

---

### 6. Information Flows — Who Has Access to Information

**What:** Dashboards, feedback channels, transparency, visibility.

**Why strong:** Behavior changes when information becomes visible to the people whose behavior matters. The structure is the same; the information flow is different.

**When useful:** When actors would make different decisions if they could *see* what they can't currently see. Very common.

**Example in software:** Showing engineers their own code's production error rate (not just the team average). Behavior changes without any policy or incentive change.

---

### 5. Rules of the System — Incentives, Punishments, Constraints

**What:** Written rules, laws, contracts, policies, norms.

**Why strong:** Rules shape all downstream behavior. Change the rule and the whole game changes.

**When useful:** When behavior is rational given current rules. The rule is the generator.

**Example in software:** A "no code merged without two approvals" rule. Changes the entire PR review dynamic. Leverage is at the rule, not at individual reviews.

**Caveat:** Rules face policy resistance (archetype 10). Actors will game them. Rules need to align with underlying incentives or they fail.

---

### 4. Self-Organization — Power to Add, Change, or Evolve System Structure

**What:** The system's ability to reshape itself — evolution, learning, adaptation, restructuring.

**Why very strong:** A self-organizing system is resilient because it can change its own rules in response to conditions.

**When useful:** Platforms, marketplaces, organizations that need to adapt faster than central control can plan.

**Example in software:** A team that can restructure itself (shift ownership, split services, change rituals) without leadership approval. Adapts to load much faster than one that can't.

---

### 3. Goals of the System

**What:** What the system is *for* — the purpose it's optimized toward.

**Why very strong:** The goal determines which of the lower-leverage points matter and how they're used. Change the goal and the whole system realigns.

**When useful:** When the system is optimizing for the wrong thing — maximizing feature velocity when the real need is user trust; maximizing uptime when the real need is experimentation.

**Example in software:** Changing a team's goal from "feature ship rate" to "user-reported quality." Everything below (rules, information flows, parameters) realigns.

---

### 2. Paradigm — The Mindset from Which the System Arises

**What:** The shared beliefs, assumptions, and worldview that generate the system's goals, rules, and structure.

**Why extremely strong:** Change the paradigm and you change everything below it. The whole system is regenerated.

**When useful:** Rarely immediate, always durable. Long-term transformations — shifts from "software as a product" to "software as a service," from "move fast break things" to "move fast with stable infrastructure."

**Example in software:** The DevOps paradigm shift (dev and ops are one) vs. the prior paradigm (dev writes, ops runs). Changed the goals, rules, structures, and information flows of software engineering.

---

### 1. Transcending Paradigms

**What:** The capacity to hold paradigms loosely, to recognize that no paradigm is "true," only more or less useful for a purpose.

**Why most powerful:** A practitioner who can step outside any paradigm can choose the right one for the situation rather than being trapped in one.

**When useful:** Crises, strategic pivots, fundamental re-imagining. Rarely applicable to routine problems.

**Example in software:** Recognizing that "the cloud" is a paradigm, not reality. For some workloads, on-prem is correct. For some, serverless. For some, bare metal. The practitioner who holds "cloud is default" loosely picks better.

---

## Execution

### Step 1: Establish the System and Goal

```
SYSTEM: [what you're trying to change]
CURRENT GOAL (implicit or explicit): [what is the system optimizing for now?]
DESIRED BEHAVIOR: [what you want instead]
```

Often the current goal is implicit — inferred from where resources flow, what metrics are watched, what behaviors are rewarded. Make it explicit. Many interventions fail because they don't realize they're fighting the actual goal.

### Step 2: Map the Candidate Interventions to Leverage Points

For each intervention under consideration, identify which level of Meadows' list it targets:

```
CANDIDATES:
- [Intervention A]: Level [N] — [why]
- [Intervention B]: Level [N] — [why]
- [Intervention C]: Level [N] — [why]
```

Usually there will be 3-6 candidates. Many will cluster at the bottom (parameters, buffers) because those are the easiest to propose.

### Step 3: Rank by Effective Leverage

**Effective leverage = Meadows leverage × feasibility** — the theoretical leverage of the level times your ability to actually execute.

A Level 2 (paradigm) intervention you can't make is zero effective leverage. A Level 12 (parameter) that you can actually push is non-zero effective leverage.

```
RANKING:
| Candidate | Meadows level | Feasibility (H/M/L) | Effective leverage |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| A         | 5 (Rules)     | M                   | High                 |
| B         | 12 (Parameter)| H                   | Low                  |
| C         | 3 (Goal)      | L (political)       | Medium (if achievable)|
```

### Step 4: Pick the Highest Feasible Leverage

**Rule of thumb:** Prefer the *highest* Meadows level that is feasible within the time and political budget. Don't waste cycles on parameter changes when a rule change is feasible.

Also: **bundle a low-level tactical intervention with a high-level structural one.** The low-level one buys time; the high-level one changes the generator.

### Step 5: Name Second-Order Effects

Every leverage-point push has second-order effects. At higher levels, these are larger.

```
INTERVENTION: [chosen]
LEVEL: [N]

INTENDED: [primary effect]
SECOND-ORDER:
- [Other variables that will shift]
- [Which loops are now stronger/weaker]
- [Which archetypes might activate]
THIRD-ORDER:
- [Behavioral adaptations]
- [Possible policy resistance]
```

## Output

```
🎯 LEVERAGE POINT ANALYSIS: [system]

SYSTEM GOAL (implicit): [...]
DESIRED BEHAVIOR: [...]

CANDIDATE INTERVENTIONS:
- [A]: Level [N]
- [B]: Level [N]
- [C]: Level [N]

HIGHEST FEASIBLE LEVERAGE: [Chosen intervention]
- Meadows level: [N]
- Why feasible: [context]
- Why highest: [why the higher levels are not feasible right now]

BUNDLED LOW-LEVEL TACTICAL INTERVENTION: [if any, to buy time]

EXPECTED EFFECTS:
- First-order: [...]
- Second-order: [...]
- Third-order: [...]

RESISTANCE TO EXPECT:
- Policy resistance from: [who, why]
- Paradigm clash: [if Level 2 or 3, what belief is threatened]

MEASURE OF SUCCESS: [how you'll know the leverage worked]
TIMELINE: [when you'll re-evaluate]
```

## Worked Example

```
SYSTEM: Our team's code review process.

CURRENT GOAL (implicit): "Maintain PR throughput." Metric: PR merge rate per week.
DESIRED BEHAVIOR: Same merge rate, but with higher defect detection.

CANDIDATES:
- [A] Require 2 reviewers instead of 1 → Level 5 (rules). Medium feasibility (political cost).
- [B] Change PR template to require "risk level" self-tag → Level 6 (information flow). High feasibility.
- [C] Change team goal from "PR merge rate" to "defects caught per PR" → Level 3 (goal). Low feasibility (requires leadership + metrics revamp).
- [D] Add a static analyzer to catch common defects → Level 12 (parameter/buffer). High feasibility.

EFFECTIVE LEVERAGE RANKING:
1. [C] Level 3 × L feasibility = M — if achievable, transformative
2. [A] Level 5 × M = M
3. [B] Level 6 × H = M
4. [D] Level 12 × H = L (weak leverage despite easy)

HIGHEST FEASIBLE: [B] — information flow (risk self-tag). Almost as much effective leverage as [A] or [C] at far lower cost.

BUNDLED TACTICAL: [D] — static analyzer, to catch the mechanical defects while the cultural shift from [B] propagates.

EXPECTED:
- First-order: Reviewers see "risk: high" and spend more time on those PRs.
- Second-order: Self-tagging calibrates over time as people learn what "high risk" means.
- Third-order: Team language shifts; "risk" becomes a shared vocabulary.

RESISTANCE: People will self-tag everything "low" to avoid scrutiny. Mitigation: make distribution visible ("team is self-tagging 95% low — is that accurate?").

MEASURE: Defects-escaped-per-PR, tracked before and after; distribution of risk tags.
TIMELINE: Re-evaluate in 8 weeks.
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Proposing only level 11-12 interventions.** Most interventions people propose are the lowest leverage. Always generate candidates at multiple levels.
- **Confusing "hard to do" with "high leverage."** A Level 2 intervention you cannot execute has zero effective leverage.
- **Ignoring second-order effects.** Higher leverage = larger unintended consequences. Run them through CausalLoop before committing.
- **Skipping the goal analysis.** If you're fighting the system's implicit goal, no amount of lower-level intervention will hold.
- **"Just change the culture."** Culture (Level 2) is real but isn't a single action. Culture-layer interventions must still have a concrete first move.

## Integration

- Runs after **CausalLoop** or **FindArchetype**
- Reference material: `../LeveragePoints.md` for full treatment with more examples
- Exits to **Ideate** or **BeCreative** for generating candidate interventions at the chosen level
