## ⚠️ MANDATORY TRIGGER

**When user says "research" (in any form), ALWAYS invoke this skill.**

| User Says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| "research" / "do research" / "research this" | → Standard mode (4 agents: Claude + Gemini + Grok + Perplexity + cross-check) |
| "quick research" / "minor research" | → Quick mode (1 Perplexity agent) |
| "extensive research" / "deep research" | → Extensive mode (7 explorers + 2 verifiers) |
| "deep investigation" / "investigate [topic]" / "map the [X] landscape" | → Deep Investigation (iterative + verification) |

**"Research" alone = Standard mode. No exceptions.**

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Research/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.


## 🚨 MANDATORY: Voice Notification (REQUIRED BEFORE ANY ACTION)

**You MUST send this notification BEFORE doing anything else when this skill is invoked.**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:31337/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running the WORKFLOWNAME workflow in the Research skill to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **Research** skill to ACTION...
   ```

**This is not optional. Execute this curl command immediately upon skill invocation.**

# Research Skill

Comprehensive research, analysis, and content extraction system.

## MANDATORY: URL Verification

**READ:** `UrlVerificationProtocol.md` - Every URL must be verified before delivery.

Research agents hallucinate URLs. A single broken link is a catastrophic failure.

---


## Workflow Routing

Route to the appropriate workflow based on the request.

**CRITICAL:** For due diligence, company/person background checks, or vetting -> **INVOKE OSINT SKILL INSTEAD**

### Research Modes (Primary Workflows)
- Quick/minor research (1 Perplexity, 1 query) -> `Workflows/QuickResearch.md`
- Standard research - DEFAULT (4 agents: Claude + Gemini + Grok + Perplexity, cross-checked) -> `Workflows/StandardResearch.md`
- Extensive research (7 explorers + 2 verifiers = 9 agents) -> `Workflows/ExtensiveResearch.md`
- Deep investigation / iterative research (progressive deepening + verification, loop-compatible) -> `Workflows/DeepInvestigation.md`

### Verification
- Verify research findings / cross-check claims / confidence scoring -> `Workflows/Verify.md`

### Deep Content Analysis
- Extract alpha / deep analysis / highest-alpha insights -> `Workflows/ExtractAlpha.md`

### Content Retrieval
- Difficulty accessing content (CAPTCHA, bot detection, blocking) -> `Workflows/Retrieve.md`
- YouTube URL extraction (use `fabric -y URL` immediately) -> `Workflows/YoutubeExtraction.md`
- Web scraping -> `Workflows/WebScraping.md`

### Specific Research Types
- Claude WebSearch only (free, no API keys) -> `Workflows/ClaudeResearch.md`
- Perplexity API research (use Quick for single-agent) -> `Workflows/QuickResearch.md`
- Interview preparation (Tyler Cowen style) -> `Workflows/InterviewResearch.md`
- AI trends analysis -> `Workflows/AnalyzeAiTrends.md`

### Fabric Pattern Processing
- Use Fabric patterns (242+ specialized prompts) -> `Workflows/Fabric.md`

### Content Enhancement
- Enhance/improve content -> `Workflows/Enhance.md`
- Extract knowledge from content -> `Workflows/ExtractKnowledge.md`

## Quick Reference

**READ:** `QuickReference.md` for detailed examples and mode comparison.

| Trigger | Mode | Speed |
|---------|------|-------|
| "quick research" | 1 Claude agent | ~10-15s |
| "do research" | 2 agents + cross-check | ~15-30s |
| "extensive research" | 7 explorers + 2 verifiers | ~60-90s |
| "deep investigation" | Progressive iteration + verification | ~3-60min |

## Verification Architecture

Inspired by Nomad (arXiv:2603.29353). Three layers of verification, zero added latency:

| Layer | What | Where | Cost |
|-------|------|-------|------|
| **Self-Verification** | Each agent verifies own URLs and tags confidence before returning | All agents | 0s (inside parallel window) |
| **Cross-Check** | Synthesis step detects conflicts and cross-references findings | Standard, Extensive, Deep | 2-3s (within synthesis) |
| **Independent Verification** | Dedicated verifier agents with no access to explorer reasoning | Extensive, Deep only | 0s (parallel with explorers) |

**Confidence tags in output:** `[HIGH]` `[MED]` `[LOW]` `[CONFLICT]`

See `Workflows/Verify.md` for full verification protocol.

## Deep Investigation Mode

**Progressive iterative research** that builds a persistent knowledge vault. Works in both single-run (one cycle) and loop mode (Algorithm-driven iterations).

**Concept:** Broad landscape → discover entities → score importance/effort → deep-dive one at a time → loop until coverage complete.

**Domain template packs** customize the investigation for specific domains:
- `Templates/MarketResearch.md` — Companies, Products, People, Technologies, Trends, Investors
- `Templates/ThreatLandscape.md` — Threat Actors, Campaigns, TTPs, Vulnerabilities, Tools, Defenders
- No template? The workflow creates entity categories dynamically from the landscape research.

**Example invocation:**
```
"Do a deep investigation of the AI agent market"
→ Loads MarketResearch.md template
→ Iteration 1: Broad landscape + first entity deep-dive
→ Loop mode: Each iteration deep-dives the next highest-priority entity
→ Exit: When all CRITICAL/HIGH entities researched + all categories covered
```

**Artifacts persist** at `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/RESEARCH/{date}_{topic}/` — the vault survives across sessions.

See `Workflows/DeepInvestigation.md` for full workflow details.

---

## File Organization

**Working files (temporary work artifacts):** `~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/WORK/{current_work}/`
- Read `~/.claude/` to get the `work_dir` value
- All iterative work artifacts go in the current work item directory
- This ties research artifacts to the work item for learning and context

**History (permanent):** `~/.claude/History/research/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_[topic]/`

## Gotchas

- **Research agents hallucinate URLs.** EVERY URL must be verified before delivery. A single broken link is a catastrophic failure.
- **"research" alone = Standard mode (2 agents + cross-check). Never default to Quick.** Users saying "research this" expect thorough results.
- **Due diligence, background checks, people lookup → OSINT skill, NOT Research.** Research handles general investigation; OSINT handles entity-specific deep investigation.
- **Don't spawn redundant research agents when you already have the answer in context.** If prior work in the session already covers the topic, skip agent spawning.
- **"extract alpha" routes to ExtractAlpha workflow — not the ExtractWisdom skill.** Different things.
- **YouTube extraction uses `fabric -y URL` directly** — don't try to scrape YouTube pages with WebFetch.

## Examples

**Example 1: Quick lookup**
```
User: "quick research on Hono SSR middleware patterns"
→ Invokes QuickResearch workflow (1 Claude agent)
→ Returns summary with key patterns and links
→ ~10-15 seconds
```

**Example 2: Standard multi-source research**
```
User: "research the current state of AI agent frameworks"
→ Invokes StandardResearch workflow (2 agents: Claude + Gemini, cross-checked)
→ Cross-references findings, confidence-tags, verifies URLs
→ Returns synthesized report with citations
→ ~15-30 seconds
```

**Example 3: Deep investigation**
```
User: "do a deep investigation of the AI agent market"
→ Invokes DeepInvestigation workflow
→ Broad landscape scan → entity discovery → priority scoring → deep-dives
→ Builds persistent knowledge vault in MEMORY/RESEARCH/
→ Loop-compatible for multi-session investigation
```

## Execution Log

After completing any workflow, append a single JSONL entry:

```bash
echo '{"ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","skill":"Research","workflow":"WORKFLOW_USED","input":"8_WORD_SUMMARY","status":"ok|error","duration_s":SECONDS}' >> ~/.claude/PAI/MEMORY/SKILLS/execution.jsonl
```

Replace `WORKFLOW_USED` with the workflow executed, `8_WORD_SUMMARY` with a brief input description, and `SECONDS` with approximate wall-clock time. Log `status: "error"` if the workflow failed.
