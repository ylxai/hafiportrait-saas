# Verify Workflow

Reusable verification layer for research outputs. Inspired by Nomad's explorer-verifier pattern (arXiv:2603.29353). Can be invoked standalone or embedded within other research workflows.

**Trigger:** Called by other workflows (ExtensiveResearch, DeepInvestigation) or standalone via "verify these findings"

---

## Core Principle

> The verifier operates independently from the explorer. It does not have access to the explorer's reasoning, and only receives the final claims for evaluation.
> — Nomad, §3.7

Verification decomposes findings into atomic sub-claims, then independently validates each. This catches errors that self-verification misses because the verifier has no confirmation bias from the exploration process.

---

## Verification Priority

Focus verification effort on the claims most likely to be wrong:

1. **Quantitative claims** (numbers, percentages, dates) — most common hallucination target
2. **Causal claims** ("X causes Y") — often asserted without evidence
3. **Recency claims** ("as of 2026") — training data may be stale
4. **Specificity claims** (exact product names, version numbers, API parameters) — easily fabricated

Don't waste verification time on general statements or widely-known facts.

## Confidence Scoring

Every claim receives a confidence tag based on verification results:

| Tag | Meaning | Criteria |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `[HIGH]` | Independently verified | Sub-claim confirmed via tool call (WebSearch, WebFetch, or document) |
| `[MED]` | Partially verified | Some sub-claims confirmed, others unverifiable but plausible |
| `[LOW]` | Unverified | No independent confirmation found, or contradicted by other sources |
| `[CONFLICT]` | Agents disagree | Two or more agents made contradictory claims on this topic |

**Default:** Missing confidence metadata = `[LOW]` (safe default).

---

## Conflict Detection

When multiple agents' results are available, scan for contradictions:

1. **Extract claim pairs** — for each topic, collect claims from all agents
2. **Detect contradictions** — claims that assert opposite conclusions on the same topic
3. **Flag with both sides** — present both claims with their sources, don't resolve
4. **Optional escalation** — for `[CONFLICT]` items, launch one targeted follow-up query

**Conflict output format:**
```
⚠️ CONFLICT on [topic]:
  Agent A (ClaudeResearcher): [claim] — [source]
  Agent B (GrokResearcher): [claim] — [source]
  Resolution: [Unresolved | Resolved by Agent C | Resolved by source priority]
```

## Verification Methods

**Tier 1: URL/Source Verification (fastest)**
- Parallel batch curl for HTTP status
- WebFetch for content matching
- Cost: ~2-3s for batch of 5-10 URLs

**Tier 2: Claim Spot-Check (medium)**
- Pick highest-impact sub-claims (quantitative, causal)
- WebSearch to independently confirm
- Cost: ~5-10s per claim checked

**Tier 3: Full Independent Verification (slowest)**
- Spawn dedicated verifier agent with claims only (no reasoning)
- Agent independently researches each sub-claim
- Cost: ~15-30s (runs in parallel with other agents)

**Mode-to-tier mapping:**
| Research Mode | Verification Tier | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Quick | None | Speed-first, single agent |
| Standard | Tier 1 + synthesis cross-check | Lightweight, <5s added |
| Extensive | Tier 1 + Tier 3 (2 verifier agents) | Full verification within 9-agent budget |
| Deep | Tier 1 + Tier 2 + Tier 3 | Iterative, verification between rounds |

## Integration Points

This workflow is designed to be called by:
- **ExtensiveResearch.md** — 2 of 9 agents run as Tier 3 verifiers
- **DeepInvestigation.md** — Tier 2 verification between Investigate and Progress Check
- **StandardResearch.md** — Tier 1 inline during synthesis
- **PAIUpgrade** — Can call Verify.md to validate upgrade recommendations
- **Any skill** — Import verification by referencing this workflow

## Graceful Degradation

- If verifier agent times out → treat all its claims as `[MED]` (not verified, not refuted)
- If URL verification fails → fall back to sequential curl
- If no conflicts detected → skip conflict section entirely (don't output empty sections)
- If only 1 agent returned results → skip cross-check, rely on self-verification only
